# MOCYBER Training Wiki

Welcome to the home of the Missouri Cyber Team's official Training Track and all things Cyber Wiki.  Our goal is to provide a clear and linear pipeline for soldiers / airmen assigned to us that is useful regardless of skill or experience level.

## Table of Contents

The [table of contents](docs/toc.md) is a work in progress.

### How To Contribute

#### 1.) Pull Requests  
Fork this repo, edit the markdown for the page(s) of your choosing, and send us a pull request.

#### 2.) Issues
File an issue with your change or addition and someone will get it added.

#### 3.) Anonymous Submission
If you have something you'd like added but don't want attributed to you, contact one of the maintainers and we'll slide it in without your name attached.

**NOTE:** New requests will be handled in that order.  Working PR's will always get posted long before manual changes.

#### "Development"

To test this out locally and see your changes before you send off an ill-fated pull request and subject yourself to the scrutiny of your peers and the Internet at large, do the following:

First, make sure you have python installed.

Next, install the requirements via Pip: `pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material pygments`

Clone the repo.

Make your changes.

Build the site (from the top level folder): `mkdocs build --clean`

Serve it up to check it out: `mkdocs serve`

Open the site at http://127.0.0.1:8000.   



Created using [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/) and the [Material Theme](http://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).
